Bugs:

Map overlapping. reservation html and contact html dded an inline styling to the map in both pages (reservation and contact) to stop the overlapping (style="width:auto; padding:100px; margin-top:50px;").

reservation form text would stay in same page. fixed that , added the message.success (it handles the success message that pops up when a reservation is booked).

Added the type="time" and type="date" also i added "required" to all.


not fixed
map still doesn't minize for some reason

no image rendering when a comment is made on a blog

known bugs that don't affect the outcome is the map.js not loading

edit read.me
